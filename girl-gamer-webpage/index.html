						<p> These kinds of games encourage players to take things slow and enjoy the cozier things in life, hence the title. Also known as wholesome games, they typically offer a slower story pace and a more relaxed style of gameplay. In a nutshell: it’s all about feeling warm, comforted, and safe. These games are designed to be relaxing and meditative, often with a focus on building relationships and the natural world. Cozy Games are not just 'turn off your brain, mindless activites', they are often engaging, thought provoking, and strategic games.</p>
